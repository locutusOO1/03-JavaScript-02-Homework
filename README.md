## Summary
This project is about generating a random password with user selected criteria.  Base HTML, CSS, and JS files have been provided.  The main task for this exercise is creating the JS logic for generating a random password.  This project has a responsive layout.  

## Execution
The base HTML file has been updated to include more semantic elements.  The base CSS file has been updated to prevent parts of larger passwords from being hidden.  The JS logic randomly traverses a 2-D array in order to first select a character set and then select a character from that set.  Once a password is generatred, focus is given to the password element and the text is selected with JS.  This allows for easier copy pasting by the user.
